\section{Introduction}

Research is hard, here are some of my tips and tricks.

\section{Zotero}

Make subcollections for different topics or projects, these can help when importing into research rabbit or other services that can recognize and work with different subcollections. 


\section{Keep a diary and take many notes}

For instance, some Google slides with header slides showing the day or week to structure the document, and subsequent slides showing some key progress, issues demonstrated by plots (with explanation of how they were generated, e.g. which settings or hyperparameters were used) et cetera. These can then be shown to supervisors when mentioning that an issue arises: they will ask about it for sure so make sure to document whatever struggles you had to show to people later on. Or to look back yourself and see if some of your changes made any improvement.

Also, this helps you keep motivated since you document what you are working on. Being stuck is also being productive.
